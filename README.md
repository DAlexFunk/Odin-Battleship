# Odin-Battleship
The battleship project from The Odin Project

## Description
This is the Battleship project from The Odin Project. This project implements the classic game Battleship as a simple webpage. The game is overall simpler than the original game; there is only support for one player, the computer's choices are fully random from the available cells, and the ship arrangements are random.

## Use
* The page can be accessed [here](https://dalexfunk.github.io/Odin-Battleship/).
* Use the random placements button to generate ship placements until you are satisfied with the arrangement.
* Then, hit start game to start the game.
* Click on cells on the right to shoot at cells (red is a hit and black is a miss).
* The computer will then shoot back at your board.
* Repeat until one side has all of their ships sunk.
* Click play again (or just refresh) to play again.
